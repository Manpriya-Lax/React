Connect 4 Game – React.js App

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of React state management, component-based architecture, and basic game logic implementation in a web application.


This is a simple **Connect 4** game built using **React.js**. The game allows two players to connect 4 dots in a 4x4 grid. The first player to connect four dots in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—wins the game.
